        A Post in an Online Group is an email to the group.
        Online Groups use email as a group collaboration medium. 
        All posts go to all participants and to the Messages area. 
        Posts can't be deleted.

        To make a post, either 
        address a new email to the Online Group's
        email address (shown on the Online Group's home page),
        or reply to a post you have received 
        via the Online Group.

        You can read posts in an Online Group
        using your email client (Outlook, GroupWise&#8230;)
        or in the Group's Messages area on this website.
        The Messages area organises the posts into 
        Conversations. You may be able to configure 
        your email software to display conversations
        (or "threads") as well.
