        Making Posts
      </heading2>
      <paragraph>
        A Post in an Online Group is an email to the group.
        Online Groups use email as a group collaboration medium. 
        All posts go to all participants and to the Topics area. 
        Posts can't be deleted.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
        To make a post, either address a new email to the Online 
        Group's email address (shown on the Online Group's home page),
        or reply to a post you have received via the Online Group.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
        You can also make posts directly from this website.
        Use the "Start a new topic" link in the Topics area 
      	of your Online Group, or scroll down to the "Add to the topic" 
      	webform when viewing a topic.

        Reading Posts
      </heading2>
      <paragraph>
        You can read posts in an Online Group
        using your email client (Outlook, GroupWise&#8230;)
        or in the Group's Topics area on this website.
        The Topics area organises the posts into 
        Topics. You may be able to configure 
        your email software to display posts as conversations
        (or "threads") as well.

        Sharing Files
      </heading2>
      <paragraph>
      	You can share one or more files with the group by attaching 
      	them to an email that you send to the group, or share a single 
      	file with the group when you post a message from this website.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
      	The files will be uploaded to the site, and a link to each file added
      	to your post. A list of the posts with attached files is clearly 
      	displayed at the top of the page when viewing a topic.

        You can email another group member directly
        any time you like. Just click on their email address
        in an email<span tal:condition="python:emailVisibility != 'nobody'">
          or <span tal:condition="python:emailVisibility == 'request'">click 'Request Email Contact'</span>
          on their profile</span>. (The jargon for this it to "back-channel".)
