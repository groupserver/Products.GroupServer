        Participation Coaching

      <paragraph>
        Each Online Group has a 
        designated Participation Coach.
        The Participation Coach initiates and encourages effective 
        participation in line with the purpose and participation 
        protocol of the Online Group. The Participation Coach 
        also manages publishing items to the Documents area.
      </paragraph>
      
      <paragraph>
        All Members of an Online Group can act as Participation Coach.
        In fact, the more the role is shared, the better. This section of 
        the Participation Guide is aimed at designated
        Participation Coaches and all Online Group
        Participants who wish to contribute to the success of 
        their Online Groups.
