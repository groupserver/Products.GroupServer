          <question>
            I sent an email to my Online Group and it hasn't appeared in the 
            'Messages' section of my Online Group.
          </question>
          <answer>
	    First check that the message was sent to the Online Group. 
            If it was, you will have received a copy of your own message. 
            It will have a shortened version of the Online Group name in the
            subject line (e.g. [groupname]).
            If you got the message and it is not in the 'Messages' section of the Online Group, please contact us.
            If you did not receive the message, check to make sure the address 
            you sent it to was correct. 
            Also check that the email address you sent the message from is 
            correct by going to your profile page. 
            You can change your email address(es) there if neccessary.

          <question>
	    When I post to my Online Group, it tells me
            I am not a member of the group but I am.
	  </question>
          <answer>
	    It may be that your email is configured such that your outgoing messages are sent from a different email address to the one that you use to receive incoming messages. The difference may be slight but it will mean that you cannot post (send email to) Online Groups. If this is the case, go to your profile page and click 'Change Email Settings'. From there, you can add the email address that you use for sending messages.
