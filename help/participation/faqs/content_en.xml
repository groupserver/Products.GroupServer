          <question>

          <answer>
      	    Visit the <a href="/reset_password.html">Reset Password page</a> and

        <faq>
          <question>
      	    How do I change my email address?
      	  </question>
          <answer>
      	    Log in and go to your
            <a tal:attributes="href python:'/contacts/%s/email.html' % user.getId()"
              tal:omit-tag="python:not(isAuthenticated)">Edit Email Settings page</a>.
            On this page you can add or remove email addresses. To add an email 
            address, type your email address into the 'Add Address' field and 
            click the 'Add' button. To remove an email address, choose 'Remove Address'
            from the drop-down list under 'Change' next to your email address.

        <faq>
          <question>
      	    How do I delete a post? How do I delete a file?
      	  </question>
          <answer>
      	    Because messages and files in <span tal:content="siteName" /> groups are sent 
      	    out via email as well as being displayed on the web, we cannot alter 
      	    or delete any post or file once it has been added to the group. (If 
      	    we did that, then the email version would be different from the web 
      	    version, which would be very strange.) Instead, we encourage you to
      	    post another message correcting your previous one.

        <faq>
          <question>
      	    When I send an email to my Online Group, I receive an email
      	    telling me I am not a member of the group even though I am.
      	  </question>
          <answer>
      	    Your email account might be configured such that your outgoing
      	    messages are sent from an email address slightly different from the 
      	    one at which you receive messages. If so, the system will not 
      	    recognize your sent emails. If the rejected address mentioned in 
      	    the email is not listed on your 
            <a tal:attributes="href python:'/contacts/%s/email.html' % user.getId()"
              tal:omit-tag="python:not(isAuthenticated)">Edit Email Settings page</a>,
            add it.

        <faq>
          <question>
            I sent an email to my Online Group and it hasn't appeared in the 
            Topics section of my Online Group.
          </question>
          <answer>
      	    First, check that the message was sent to the Online Group. If it 
      	    was, you will have received a copy of your own message. It will have
      	    a shortened version of the Online Group name in the subject line 
      	    (e.g. [groupname]). If you got the message and it is not in the 
      	    Topics section of the Online Group on this website, please 
      	    <a href="mailto:support@onlinegroups.net">contact us</a>. If 
      	    you did not receive the message, check to make sure the email address you 
      	    sent it to was correct. Also check that the email address you sent 
      	    the message from is registered to your profile. You can do this by 
      	    going to your 
            <a tal:attributes="href python:'/contacts/%s/email.html' % user.getId()"
              tal:omit-tag="python:not(isAuthenticated)">Edit Email Settings page</a>.
            You can change your email address(es) there if neccessary.

        <faq>
          <question>
      	    On my 'Edit Email Settings' page, what does 'Default'
      	    mean?
      	  </question>
          <answer>
	          If you select 'Make default' under 'Change' next to your email 
	          address, you will receive posts from all your Online Groups
	          at that address unless you specify otherwise.

          <question>
            How do I change my settings so that messages from one or more 
            particular groups are delivered to an email address that is not in 
            my list of default addresses?

      	    View your profile page and click the 'Edit Email Settings' link. 
      	    Under the heading 'Group Email Delivery Settings', find the group(s)
      	    for which that you wish to change delivery settings and click 
      	    'Change' on the line beginning 'Email Setting:'. Choose the 
      	    'Specific Address or Addresses' option and check the box next to the
