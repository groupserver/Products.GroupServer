            Create Members in Bulk

          <p>
            Create Members in Bulk requires a CSV (Comma Separated Values) file.
            The CSV file must contain at least the first name, last name
            and email address of each member.
          </p>
          <p>    
            The creation of a large number of members may take a long time, and you
            may get a timeout.
            If this occurs, please do not retry until you have confirmed
            with the groupserver administrator that the members have not
            been created, otherwise double the number of members may be
            created. 
            To reduce the chance of this happening, large numbers of
            users should be created in smaller batches (eg. 100 at a
            time).

            Other profile values can be set at this time.
