        Roles in Online Groups
      </heading1>
      <paragraph>
        Online Groups require adequate support, if they are to flourish. That support involves a variety of roles, interacting with each other and each attending to a particular aspect of support for the online group.
        </paragraph>    
      <paragraph>
        It is important that all participants in the project know who is in each role and what their responsibilities in that role are.
        </paragraph>        
      <paragraph>
        There are no universally accepted definitions for roles in online groups. The definitions presented here have been developed by OnlineGroups.Net.
        </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
        The roles in an online group are:

      <paragraph>
        All members of an online group are participants. Participants participate when they perceive some current or future benefit to them in doing so.
        Some participants merely "be" in the group. Some may not even know that they are in the group. Others pay some higher level of attention to activity in the group.
        </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
        Active participants contribute to the activity in the group. They advance ideas or information, ask and answer questions, add to each other's answers, provide alternative answers and acknowledge each other.
        </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
        Participants may be the staff, students or customers of the Owner or may be members of the public. As well as benefitting the participants themselves, participation benefits the Owner.
        </paragraph>
      
      <heading2 id="owner">
        Owner
        </heading2>
      <paragraph>
        The Owner is the person or organisation that has commissioned the 
        establishment of the online group in order to achieve particular benefits.
        When the owner is an organisation, one person represents the organisation.
        Along with the Participants, 
        the Owner is a key stakeholder in the project. 
        When the participants participate, the Owner benefits and 
        the participants benefit. 
        The Owner has the authority to initiate and to terminate the Online Group project.
        </paragraph>   
      
      <paragraph>
        Online Groups are not and can not be democracies. One person 
        always has the administrator's password. It is important that 
        people know who that is and who they are accountable to. 
        Even if the group itself was, nominally the owner, without a 
        very clearly defined constitution and decision-making process, 
        any real process to make major decisions could quickly subsume 
        getting on with the intended business of the group.
        </paragraph>
      
      <paragraph>
        The Participation Coach and Administrator are accountable to the Owner.
