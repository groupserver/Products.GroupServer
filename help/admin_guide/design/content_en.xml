        Design of Online Groups
      </heading1>
      
      <paragraph>
        Online Groups are virtual places. They exist in the imaginations 
        of the participants. When people act on their belief that an
        online group exists, and post to it, this strengthens the 
        participants' belief in the existence of the online group. Online
        groups are more coherent when the participants have a single 
        shared view of what the online group is. To develop successful 
        online groups, it is therefore important to clearly communicate 
        what kind of a place the online group is, both to the participants 
        and to non-participants. The settings in the software, all actions
        taken by the owner, participation coach and the administrator, 
        must be consistent with this. Once the group has been launched,
        the design should never be changed.
      </paragraph>
      
      <paragraph>
        The Design defines the purpose of the online group, and its main boundaries:
      </paragraph>
      
      <bulletlist>
        <listitem>
        <bold>Membership</bold>. Who can be in the group and what their roles are.
        </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <bold>Participation Protocol</bold>. What is ok in the online group.
        </listitem>
      </bulletlist>
      
      <paragraph>
        The Design must be based on an understanding of the nature and requirements of the 
        (Real Life) group that the Online Group is for. If this understanding is not present, 
        an Assessment must be carried out. If the OnlineGroups.Net Consultant and Online Group 
        Owner, together have that understanding, then the documentation of  it that will be 
        implicit in this Design will be sufficient documentation. It is important that the Design
        Elements are assessed carefully against the criteria provided for each element as 
        this will ensure that the design is well-linked to the shared understanding of 
        the nature and requirements of the group.

      <heading2>
        Owner
      </heading2>
      
      <paragraph>
        Is it important that the participants know who convened
        the establishment of the Online Group. See 
      <link url="../roles/index.xml#owner">Roles in Online Groups</link>
        for more information.
      </paragraph>
      
      
      <heading2>
        Real Life Group
      </heading2>
      
      <paragraph>
        The Real Life Group is the group of people that the Online Group is for. 
        The group might or might not exist already. It is important to distinguish 
        the Real Life Group from the Online Group as they are separate entities. 
        The Real Life Group meets in the Online Group, and may also meet face to face or via other media.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
        The Real Life Group should be named in such a way that it can be used to 
        complete the statement "[OnlineGroupName] is an Online Group for ...".
      </paragraph>
      
      <heading2>
        Purpose Statement
      </heading2>
      
      <paragraph>
        The purpose statement defines the reason for the existence of the Online Group. 
        The purpose of the Online Group is different to the  purpose of the Real Life group. 
        purpose of the Online Group is usually to, in some way, enable the Real Life Group to achieve its purpose. 
        The Purpose Statement must define how the Online Group will enable the Real Life Group to achieve its purpose.
        It must do so in a straightforward way that is compelling and attractive to the group members.
      </paragraph>
      
      <heading2>
        Membership Criterion
      </heading2>
      
      <paragraph>
        The Membership Definition is the most defined boundary that an Online Group has. 
        It determines who can be in the group. The membership must be defined in such a way that 
        it can be implemented in an even-handed way in the future.
      </paragraph>   
      <paragraph>
        It is important that group participants know, not just who is in the group at present, 
        but who might join the group in future. It is also important that participants know 
        that they may no longer meet the membership criterion in future, for example if the 
        membership is restricted to current office-holders in a committee.
      </paragraph>   
      <paragraph>
        Membership is conditional on compliance with the Participation Protocol.
      </paragraph>
      
      <heading2>
        Visibility
      </heading2>
      
      <paragraph>
        The boundaries of Online Groups are highly variable. Groups can be very public, very private
        and have a number of levels of privacy in between those. It is important that the level of 
        privacy is appropriate to the requirements for the group and that it is communicated very clearly to the participants.
      </paragraph>
      
      <heading2>
        Participation Coach
      </heading2>
      
      <paragraph>
        Each Online Group has a designated 
        Participation Coach. See 
      <link url="../roles/index.xml#participation_coach">Roles in Online Groups</link>
        for more information.
      </paragraph>
      
      <heading2>
        Location
      </heading2>
      
      <paragraph>
        All Online Groups are located in a site. Project Owners with multiple Online Groups often have a site of their own.
        Where a new site is to be established, a Site Design is required. Where the Online Group is
        to be located in a site that already exists, or for which a Site Design has been completed, all that is required is to name that site. 
      </paragraph>
      
      <heading2>
        Name
      </heading2>
      
      <paragraph>
        The name is the most important design element of an Online Group. It embodies the essence 
        of the group and, if it works, will become a shared shorthand for all the participants know and value about the group.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
        The key criteria for a name are:
      </paragraph>
      <bulletlist>
      <listitem>
          Brevity
        </listitem>
      <listitem>
          Potency
        </listitem>
      <listitem>
          Accuracy
        </listitem>
      <listitem>
          Fit
        </listitem>
      <listitem>
          Brevity
        </listitem>
        
        
      </bulletlist>    
      <paragraph>    
        The name should be easy to say and to refer to in email. It should be suitable for use 
        in a url and an email address (probably all in lower case). The name can have "full" and "short" versions.
      </paragraph>
      <heading3>
        Potency
      </heading3>
      <paragraph>
        The name should be interesting and engaging so that it communicates a lot of meaning. 
        Double meanings and humour can be useful in generating names that are catchy but not overdone.
      </paragraph>
      <heading3>
        Accuracy
      </heading3>
      <paragraph>
        The name should encapsulate or evoke:
      </paragraph>
      <bulletlist>
      <listitem>
          the people (the real life group whilst distinguishing the Online Group clearly from the Real Life Group)
        </listitem>
      <listitem>
          the place
        </listitem>
      <listitem>
          the purpose
        </listitem>
      <listitem>
          the participation
        </listitem>
      <listitem>
          the passion
        </listitem>
      </bulletlist>
      
      <heading3>
        Fit
      </heading3>
      <paragraph>
        must make room for other linked groups to be named
      </paragraph>
      <heading3>
        Hyphens vs Underscores
      </heading3>
      <paragraph>
        The Internet convention seems to be that underscores are a replacement for spaces 
        and hyphens are a separator (perhaps between set and member in set-member). For online group names, either makes sense.
      </paragraph>
      
      <heading2>
        Participation Protocol
      </heading2>
      
      <paragraph>
        The Participation Protocol defines the secondary boundary for the Online Group. 
        It defines "what is OK" in the Online Group. The Membership Definition 
        (the primary boundary) is conditional on compliance with the Participation Protocol.
      </paragraph>
      
      <heading2>
        Encouraged Participation
      </heading2>
      
      <paragraph>
        The Encouraged Participation items provide a chance to name the particular kinds 
        of participation that are expected to achieve the purpose for the Participants and the Owner.
