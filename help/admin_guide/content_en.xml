        Most online groups fail. Either no participation occurs at all or
        the participation that occurs does not achieve the intended purpose
        of the group.
        The chances that relevant participation will occur can be increased
        by adequate <link url="design/">design</link> and support and by
        having a clear <link url="roles/">role</link> for participant 
        in the project. 
        Even with both of these, participation development is often slow.
