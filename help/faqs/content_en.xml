          On this page you can add or remove email addresses. To add an email 
          address, type your email address into the 'Add Address' field and 
          click the 'Add' button. To remove an email address, choose 'Remove Address'
          from the drop-down list under 'Change' next to that email address.

          If you wish to share a link to a webpage with your group, simply paste 
          the URL of the webpage into the <cite>Message</cite> section of the 
          page, along with the rest of your post.
        </p>
        <p>
          You should only use the <cite>File</cite> section of the page to 
          select and upload a file that is saved to your local computer.

        <p>
    	    Because messages and files in <span tal:content="siteName" /> groups are sent 
    	    out via email as well as being displayed on the web, we cannot alter 
    	    or delete any post or file once it has been added to the group. (If 
    	    we did that, then the email version would be different from the web 
    	    version, which would be very strange.) Instead, we encourage you to
    	    post another message correcting your previous one.

    	    Your email account might be configured such that your outgoing
    	    messages are sent from an email address slightly different from the 
    	    one at which you receive messages. If so, the system will not 
    	    recognize your sent emails. If the rejected address mentioned in

        <p>
    	    First, check that the message was sent to the Online Group. If it 
    	    was, you will have received a copy of your own message. It will have
    	    a shortened version of the Online Group name in the subject line 
    	    (e.g. [groupname]). If you got the message and it is not in the 
    	    Topics section of the Online Group on this website, please 
    	    <a class="emaillink" title="Email address for support"
            tal:define="supportEmail python:get_support_email(context, siteId)"
            tal:attributes="href string:mailto:${supportEmail}">contact us</a>. If 
    	    you did not receive the message, check to make sure the email address you 
    	    sent it to was correct. Also check that the email address you sent 
    	    the message from is registered to your profile. You can do this by 
    	    going to your 
          <a tal:attributes="href python:'/p/%s/email.html' % user.getId()"
            tal:omit-tag="python:not(isAuthenticated)">Edit Email Settings page</a>.
          You can change your email address(es) there if neccessary.

        <h>On my 'Edit Email Settings' page, what does 'Default' mean?</h>
        <p>
          If you select 'Make default' under 'Change' next to your email 
          address, you will receive posts from all your Online Groups
          at that address unless you specify otherwise.
