                  Note: Administrator Adding an Email Address
                      Some administrators can add an email address to your profile. If
                      this occurs you will receive an email message that will allow
                      you to carry out one of the two tasks in Step 4 above. In
                      addition, you will receive an email message on *all* your other
                      addresses informing you that an administrator has added a new
                      address to your profile.

            <p>
            To post to a group, and receive email messages from a 
            group, you must register an account with GroupServer. 
            To use the Web to register an account with GroupServer, 
            carry out the following tasks.
            </p>

            <ol>
              <li>
                  1. Click Register and Join in the group you wish to join. The
                     Register and Join page will be shown.

              <li>
                  3. Click Next. Two things will happen:
                     * A email address verification message will be sent to you (see
                       Adding an Email Address, Step 4)
                       http://groupserver.org/r/post/6b5rm4OsiHJ4kWpZ37jUOl
                       and
                     * You will be shown the Edit Profile page.
              </li>

              <li>
                  4. Edit your profile. Your profile will allow other users of
                     GroupServer to get to know you better. At this stage you can also
                     join other  groups, by selecting them in the Groups section of
                     your profile.

                     Tip: Nickname
                        Your nickname is a single word that is used to identify you and
                        your profile. Its primary purpose is to create the link to your
                        profile. By default, your nickname is created out of your
                        display name, with the spaces removed.
              </li>

              <li>
                  5. Click Next. You will be shown one of two pages.

                     * If you have not verified your email address (see Adding an Email
                       Address, Step 4) you will be shown the Waiting for Verification
                       page; once you verified click Next to see the Set Password page
                       (see Resetting Your Password step 6).

                     * If you have verified your email address, you will be shown the
                       Set Password page (see Resetting Your Password, Step 6).

            <p>
                  Note: Administrator Registration
                      If you do not have an account with GroupServer, an administrator
                      can create one for you. If this happens, you will receive an
                      email message informing you that this has occurred. Clicking on
                      the link in the email message will take you to the Edit Profile
                      page (Step 4 above) and verify your email address.

                <p>
                  A tag is a keyword, or category, that is associated with
                  a post.
                  You can associate multiple tags with a post
                  when it is created; this should make the file easier for
                  others to find 
                  (see 
                  <cite href="#groupserver-reading-messages">
                    Reading Messages</cite>, and 
                  <cite href="#groupserver-viewing-files">
                    Viewing Files</cite>).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Currently, tags can only be entered via the Web
                  (see
                  <cite href="#groupserver-posting-a-message">
                    Posting Messages</cite>
                   and
                  <cite href="#groupserver-post-files">Posting Files</cite>).
                  When entering a tag, they can be formatted in one of two
                  ways.
                </p>
                <dl>

                    <dt>Space separated</dt>
                    <dd>
                      The tags are separated by spaces, with quote-characters
                      used to group words together, such as the following four 
                      tags:
                      <code>tags "example post" email message</code>

                    <dt>Comma separated</dt>
                    <dd>
                      The tags are separated by commas, which also allow words
                      to be grouped together, such as the following four tags:
                      <code>tags, example post, email, message</code>                      
                    </dd>

                  To create a topic using email, send a message to the
                  email address for the group
                  (such as 
                  <code class="email">example_group@onlinegroups.net</code>)
                  with the message subject set to the name of topic;
                  do not use the name of an existing topic as this will cause
                  the message to be added to the existing topic, rather than
                  creating a new topic.
                  If you are not a member of a group you cannot create a new
                  topic, and you will be sent an error message informing you
                  why you cannot post to the group.
                  However, people who are not <span class="site" tal:content="siteName"/> users will not 
                  receive error messages.

            <p>
              Sometimes it is useful to send someone a link to a post.
              To create a link, view the message you wish to link to
              (see 
              <cite href="#groupserver-reading-messages-using-the-web">Reading
                Messages Using the Web</cite>)
              and click <samp class="link">short link</samp>, at the
              top of the  message; the post will be shown on a single
              Web page.
              You can copy the address of the message from
              the location bar of your Web browser and paste it into any 
              message you wish to send.
              If the recipient cannot view the post, because of inadequate 
              permissions, then an error message will be shown when he or she
              tries and follow the link.

          Should the files be managed in a seperate tab to

          - Yes. We do not want the files to appear as if they are
            version-controlled with the contents of the page.
          Will the files be version-controlled?
          - Maybe. Pros: No over-writing files. No one asking us
            for the old version back.
            Cons: Adding a new version of a file (house.jpg) will
              not cause the page to update (or will it?)
          Will the files be attached to the page-versions?
          - No. That will just confuse people too much.
          Permissions?
          - Same as page, with history needed to view the prior 
            version of files (if we version control files).
