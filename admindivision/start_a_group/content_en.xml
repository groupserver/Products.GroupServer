          A discussion group is used to discuss
          topics.
          It allows all the group members to post messages, and
          files, that can be read by all the other group
          members.
          When started, a discussion-group can have up to five
          members, though more can be added.

          An announcement group is used to inform the
          group members of an event, a happening, or some other item of
          news.
          Unlike a discussion group, only a few members can post to
          the group (up to five).
          When started, 30 people can receive posts made to an
          announcement-group, though more can be added.

      <heading2 id="real_life_group">Real-Life Group</heading2>

      <paragraph>What type of people will belong to the new
        online-group?
        For example, the online group may be for people who collect
        toys,  people who like to discuss aspects of local
        politics, or members of a particular project.
        In essence, the real-life group defines who belongs to the
        group, and what topics are discussed in the group.
        For a public group, the real-life group is the second
        indication on what the group is for, after the group name.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
        The real-life group will be used to complete the sentence
        &#8220;This group is an online group for&#8230;&#8221;,
        which will appear on the group homepage.
