Introduction
============

This product contains the ``GroupServer`` class, which forms the core of a
GroupServer_ instance. Its main responsibility is for setting up the
initial site during installation. It does little else, with most of the
functionality of GroupServer being provided by the many ``gs.*`` eggs.
