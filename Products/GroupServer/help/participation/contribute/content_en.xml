          <span tal:content="siteName" /> allows group members to contribute a 
          post by sending it in to the group as an email message. The subject 
          line of the email should be the topic of the post, and the text of 
          the post should be written in the body of the email message. Files
          should be attached as usual.

        <p>
          Accurate subject lines enable group members to identify the 
          topic of an email message before they read it. Subject
          lines are also used to organize posts on the website into readable 
          sequences known as "topics". Well-organized topics make it possible
          to follow multiple concurrent conversations. It is therefore important 
          to add to existing topics where appropriate, and to write good subject 
          lines when starting new topics.

          The more clear and thoughtful your post, the easier it is for others
          to understand. When people can understand your message, they are more 
          willing to pay attention and respond to it.

              Keep your post as short and to-the-point as possible: if it

              When you finish writing, re-read your message with your
